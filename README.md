# CTensor
This is a tensor implementation in C.
Tensor is a Multidimensional Array commonly used in deep learning.
I am currently working on adding that feature.


Testing Framework:
* CuTest


## Tensor
The practical implementation is a 1d array, and element indexing is performed through a strided indexing scheme.

### Usage
```C
#include "src/tensor/tensor.h"
Tensor* input = createTensor(SHAPE(10), 1, 1.0);
Tensor* image = createTensor(SHAPE(3,224,224) , 3, 0.0);

Linear* linear = createLinear(10, 20, true);
```

## To Do
* Decouple the method from the struct.
* Implement Convoulation. üìù
* Implement Network container (may be generic. üìù
